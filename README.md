# FOSE-FOUNDATION
We have incorporated a non-profit called FREE AND OPEN SOURCE EDUCATION (FOSE) FOUNDATION, www.fosefoundation.org.

FOSE transforms proven educational games from the physical to the digital, literally expanding their impact to the whole world.

Free Market Kids has given FOSE FOUNDATION license to use the DIGITAL VERSIONS of our games.

👀 I’m interested in funding the minimum viable product (MVP) of DIGITAL HODL UP through FOSE.

⚡ Fun fact: We also have a Lightning game (CHANNEL UP), a seed phrase game (BIP39), and others in the development pipeline.

📫 How to reach me: scott@fosefoundation.org

😄 Happy Hodling!
